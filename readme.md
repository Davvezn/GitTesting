# Project 1: Minidatabase

## Description
Its a simple and minor database to add, read, update and delete data in a structured way and without any complications. It is simply used for stuff like keeping track and adding notes. 

The code is in C and was made in vscode, addiotiinally used git and github(desktop) to simplify the process of commits, pushes and pulls. This was addiotionally done in order to have easy access to the log information provided by github. (lie i only used git but i would use github and github desktop normally).
